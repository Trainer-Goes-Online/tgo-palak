      <h2>1. About the service</h2>
      <p>The Clarity Call is a paid 30-minute 1:1 educational clinical nutrition assessment with Palak, a clinical functional nutritionist. The fee is ₹499. On the call, Palak reviews the information and reports you share and gives you an educational view of what may be driving how you feel, which markers your current reports may be missing, and what to look at first.</p>

      <h2>2. What the service is not</h2>
      <p>The Clarity Call is for education and guidance only. It is not medical treatment, diagnosis, a prescription, or emergency care. It does not create a doctor and patient relationship. It is meant to work alongside the care of your own doctor, never to replace it. You should not stop, start, or change any medication based on the call. Always consult your doctor before making any medical decision. If you are having a medical emergency, do not use this service. Contact your doctor or your local emergency number right away.</p>

        <li>The fee for one Clarity Call is ₹499, payable in advance through our payment processor, Razorpay.</li>
        <li>Your booking is confirmed only after your payment is received and you receive a confirmation from us.</li>

      <h2>4. Your responsibilities</h2>

        <li>Understand that any guidance is general and educational, and that decisions about your treatment rest with you and your doctor.</li>
        <li>Continue to follow your doctor&rsquo;s advice and not change your medication based on the call.</li>
        <li>Be over 18 and booking for yourself.</li>

      </ul>

Every body is different, and outcomes depend on many factors outside our control. To the extent allowed by law, FitWithPalak is not liable for any loss or harm that results from relying on the educational guidance given on the call, from any decision you make based on it, or from any change you make to your health or medication without your doctor.
